# Agents in JAX (AJAX): A JAX-Based Library for Modular and Efficient RL Agents

AJAX is a high-performance reinforcement learning library built entirely on **JAX**. It provides a modular and extensible framework for implementing and training RL agents, enabling **massive speedups** for parallel experiments on **TPUs/GPUs**. AJAX is designed to be **efficient**, **scalable**, and **easy to modify**, making it ideal for both research and production use.

### **End-to-End JAX**
- Fully implemented in JAX, ensuring seamless integration and hardware acceleration.
- Enables efficient parallelization for large-scale experiments on GPUs/TPUs.

### **Modular Design**
- Easily customize networks, optimizers, and training loops.
- Designed for researchers to quickly prototype and modify agents.

### **Available Agents**
- **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**: For continuous action spaces, with support for temperature tuning and efficient Q-function updates.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: Coming soon, with support for recurrent policies and parallel environments.
- More agents to come!

### **Environment Compatibility**
- Works seamlessly with **Gymnax** and **Brax** environments, including the handling of truncation vs termination of episodes.
- Supports both single and parallel environments.

### **Replay Buffer**
- Efficient trajectory storage and sampling using **flashbax**.

### **Highly Optimized**
- Memory-efficient updates using `donate_argnums`.
- JAX-based implementation for GPU/TPU acceleration.

### **Parallel Logging**
- Allows for **live logging from multiple parallel run on a single device**, directly to Weight & Biases !

### **Upcoming Features**
- **Recurrent Support**: Optional LSTM-based recurrent networks for partially observable environments.
- **Profiling**: Profiling tool to cleanly measure the performance (speed and RAM) of jax agents.

## üìñ Usage

### **Training an Agent**
To train an agent using AJAX, run the following command:
```python
env_id = "halfcheetah"
sac_agent = SAC(
        env_id=env_id,
    )
sac_agent.train(seed=[1,2,3], n_timesteps=int(1e6))
```
Replace `<environment_name>` with the desired environment (e.g., `gymnax.CartPole-v1`).
