# Agents in JAX (AJAX): A JAX-Based Library for Modular and Efficient RL Agents

AJAX is a high-performance reinforcement learning library built entirely on **JAX**. It provides a modular and extensible framework for implementing and training RL agents, enabling **massive speedups** for parallel experiments on **TPUs/GPUs**. AJAX is designed to be **efficient**, **scalable**, and **easy to modify**, making it ideal for both research and production use.

## üìñ Usage

### **Training an Agent**
To train an agent using AJAX, run the following command:
```python
env_id = "halfcheetah"
sac_agent = SAC(
        env_id=env_id,
    )
sac_agent.train(seed=42, num_timesteps=int(1e6))
```
Replace `<environment_name>` with the desired environment (e.g., `gymnax.CartPole-v1`) and `<config_file>` with the path to your configuration file.
